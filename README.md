Goal:

Create a pangenome of SAR11 and see all the transport and catabolic genes related to metabolite utilization.

It would inform me of all the common gene clusters of all known SAR11 genomes and see how diverse their diet is.

This website provides some guidance: https://merenlab.org/2016/11/08/pangenomics-v2/

Class 4/4:
Identify data: 
Include HASH
Include Metadata


Notes from Meeting with Steven 4/7:

Data:Found four genomes from NCBI that are full genomes of cultured data. Morris Lab is also providing two genomes that have not been published. 
What genes are present, multiple copies, the unique genes?

Downloading through curl the complete genomes and acquire the annotations.

I am bit confused about HASH??

goal: presense and absence of genomes.
