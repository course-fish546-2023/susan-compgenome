SAR11 Presentation Slides:

https://rpubs.com/sggarcia6/1034652

Plan for 4 weeks:

Above are the slides with results obtained with one comparison of one reference genome to another genome of SAR11.

week 7:
finish comparison of 6 genomes in total of interest to the reference genome of HTCC 1062.
Begin a working of the heatmap where one can start seeing the presensence and absence of genes.

Overaching goal: see if automizing the multiple genomes is doable.

Week 8:

Working on HEatmap and finish.

Seeing the automizing of multiple genomes to be comapred.

Week 9:

REvise Code and organize and make sure it is readable to audience. Organize data. 
Create slides for the resutls to be shown.

Week 10:
final touches to present. 

This could be my final figure for my project? I hope.

SR-files-4-blast.Rmd is the file that Steven Roberts created to take many files 

01sar11blastp.Rmd is the file that was the first. it has the basic idea of how to blast and how I did it.

02allsar11.Rmd is the file that combined all protein sequences.
