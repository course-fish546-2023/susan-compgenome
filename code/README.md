https://rpubs.com/sggarcia6/1034652

Plan for 4 weeks:

Above are the slides with results obtained with one comparison of one reference genome to another genome of SAR11.

week 7:
finish comparison of 6 genomes in total of interest to the reference genome of HTCC 1062.
Begin a working of the heatmap where one can start seeing the presensence and absence of genes.

Overaching goal: see if automizing the multiple genomes is doable.

Week 8:

Working on HEatmap and finish.

Seeing the automizing of multiple genomes to be comapred.

Week 9:

REvise Code and organize and make sure it is readable to audience. Organize data. 
Create slides for the resutls to be shown.

Week 10:
final touches to present.
